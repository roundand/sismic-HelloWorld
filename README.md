This is a project for me to learn various things:

- Python, since this is my first Python project,
- Statecharts, an area which I have long been interested in,
- Sismic, to pick a specific statechart library, and
- BDD / statechart integration, since I have experience of test automation using Gherkin in both golang and C#

I will regard this project as successfully completed when I can demonstrate BDD testing for sismic statecharts as outlined in https://sismic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/behavior.html
